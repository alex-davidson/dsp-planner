# DspPlanner

CLI tool for doing production planning for Dyson Sphere Program.

Not intended to be a solver; given a production target and set of rules, it simply works out
the associated costs and supporting production lines. Gives up and throws errors if anything is
ambiguous or unspecified.

Could probably do this with a spreadsheet but I don't feel like reading all of Google's docs in
search of That One Function.

I do not expect to finish this project any time soon, because coding late gives me a headache.
